You can make a Card class. This might be new if you are new to programming, but it's not super complicated and has a lot of advantages — it makes your code more readable and lets you define data and behavior in one structure. I've added some comments under the methods to help. A class will let you make individual instances of the cards that encapsulate date like the value and range. Additionally you can add behavior, like what happens when you print a card or add two cards together. Here's a rough start:

class Card:
    suits = {
        'c': '♣',
        'h': '♥',
        's': '♠',
        'd': '♦'
    }
    faces = {
        1: 'Ace',
        11: 'Jack',
        12: 'Queen',
        13: 'King'
    }
    def __init__(self, rank, suit):
        '''Called when you create a new card. For example `Card(10, 'h')`'''
        self.rank = rank
        self.suit = suit
    
    def __repr__(self):
        '''A string representation of the card'''
        face = self.faces.get(self.rank, self.rank)
        return f'{face}{self.suits[self.suit]}'
        
    def __add__(self, other):
        '''What happens when you add a card to another (or to an integer)
           For example this_card + someOther_card'''
        if isinstance(other, int):
            return self.rank + other
        return self.rank + other.rank

    def __radd__(self, other):
        '''What happens when you add another or integer to this card. 
           For example `someOther_card + this_card`'''
        if isinstance(other, int):
            return other + self.rank
        return self.rank + other.rank
    


Now you can use it.

Make a new card:
    acard = Card(10, 'h')
    print(acard)
    # 10♥
    acard.rank
    # 10

Make a full deck:
    sorted_deck = [Card(n, s) for s in Card.suits for n in range(1, 14)]

    len(sorted_deck)
    # 52
    sorted_deck[10: 15] # take a slice of the deck
    # [Jack♣, Queen♣, King♣, Ace♥, 2♥]

Shuffle it and draw a hand of 7:
    from random import shuffle

    shuffle(sorted_deck)
    sorted_deck[0:7]
    # [4♣, 3♣, 10♥, 8♥, 7♦, 3♥, 2♠]

Sum the values of some card:
    cards = [Card(9, 'h'), Card(11, 'd'), Card(1, 's')]

    sum(cards)
    # 21
