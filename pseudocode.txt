Crime Scanner
    Sound Clues
        different sounds for different criminal activities/movements
            Floor steps - floor space within a building
            Door creak - door space
            Glass break - window space
            Street - street space
            Subway - indicates taking subway 'somewhere'
                follow by at least 1 street, can not end turn on subway space
            Nothing/beep - criminal doesn't move
    Tracks criminal movement 'covertly'
        Criminal can move 'faster' than detectives on the board by using the 'numbered' spaces
            generally equivelent to 2x the detective movement
        can 'replay' up to 9 previous steps (10 steps counting current and previous)

            Increases bounty and allows several 'free' moves to 'get away'


Thief movement
    When
        Each time a 'clue' is requested
        After unsuccessful Arrest
    Direction
        Up/Down/Left/Right and diagonally beteen those
            Always 2 'board spaces', moving from 1 numbered space to another numbered space
            Diagonal movement can be used to access a door or window, crossing over what may appear as a 'half space' visually on the board grid (generlly due to a diagonal wall at that location)
        Exceptions
            Will not immediately 'backtrack' or return to the previous numbered space on the very next turn
                Could backtrack within 3 steps (triangle move pattern)
    Other Rules
        After breaking a window or opening a door, the next movment MUST be 'through' the space, not back to the previous (similar to backtracking exception)
        Thief will not go through/over walls
        When inside a building, if the thief comes within 1 space of a crime location, he will always commit the crime on the next move
            Note1: once a crime location has been 'triggered' it becomes a 'floor' space until the thief leaves the building (all building crime locations that may have been triggerd are reset)
            Note2: once the newsstand is robbed, it will close and become a 'street' space until the thief is arrested and a new thief is on the loose
    Subway use
        If the thief ends their turn at the space in front of a corner or the center subway, they always take it on their next turn
            After riding, they will exit onto the street directly in front of the subway
                They MAY even return to the same subway station during the 'ride', and thus same numbered street space (allowed to violate the backtrack exception here)
    Escape Arrest
        Thief will move 5 to 6 times if they escape arrest, possibly committing additional crime along the way
